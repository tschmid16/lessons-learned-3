API is the bridge of communication between two different systems. It could be a one-way communication or two-way.
Information is fed from one system to another (e.g. A to B); the information is then used for a process in system B.
It is possible that system B would also generate a report back to system A through the API.



Let's look at an example below for an API between an ecommerce site and its shipping partner:

From ecommerce site to shipping partner:
- order info (dimensions, weight, customer address, pickup location, delivery speed)


From shipping partner to ecommerce site:
- given order info, shipper partner calculates price quote and sends that back to ecommerce site.
- once product is shippied, tracking number and shipping status is provided
