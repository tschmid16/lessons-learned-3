<h3>About Agile software development</h3>
<b>Agile software development</b> is a popular method to develop software that promotes an incremental approach, as opposed to big design upfront (BDU) approaches.<BR/>
Agile software development emerged in the 1990s in response to the then-dominant <b>waterfall</b> software development approach, which some engineers criticized as overly controlled, inflexible and heavyweight. In early 2001, several leading software developers gathered and published the Manifesto for Agile Software Development that promoted a different philosophy when it came to making the traditional trade-offs in software development:
<UL>
<LI>
Individuals and interactions over Processes and tools</LI><LI>
Working software over Comprehensive documentation</LI><LI>
Customer collaboration over Contract negotiation</LI><LI>
Responding to change over Following a plan</LI>
</UL>
While there are many variants of Agile software development, there are a number of characteristics that usually apply:
<UL>
<LI>The development cycle revolves around relatively short (1-4 week) iterations (<B>sprints</B>) that aim to deliver a working product to the client at the end of each cycle. The goals for a specific sprint are only set at the beginning of that sprint.</LI>
<LI>There is a <B>product owner</B> assigned who serves as an intermediary between client and developers. During each sprint the product owner promotes efficient communication.</LI>
<LI>There are frequent (often daily) <B>stand ups</B> in which developers report to the rest of the team what they have accomplished and what they are planning to do next.</LI>
<LI>The development approach often adopts specific techniques to improve quality and efficiency, including test-driven development (TDD), continuous integration, and code refactoring.</LI>
</UL>
Over the years, Agile development has evolved into two main branches: Agile/Scrum and Lean Software Development.
