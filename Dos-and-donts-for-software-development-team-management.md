Besides the classes, I believe that reading the Pragmatic Programmer contributed a lot to my future decision making 
and organizational understanding of IT related projects. Being a consultant at this stage of my life
and knowing that I will be returning to consultancy, I know I will merit from knowing the musts and pitfalls
related to software development management:

1. Organize teams around functionality so build the teams the way the code is built.
2. Know how to estimate project duration, avoid surprises and be aware of timing mistakes and scope creep
3. Try to over-deliver a tiny bit to create happy clients
4. Fix errors when you see them
5. Judge tools on their merits and don't assume that costly tools produce better designs 
6. As in any project setup, make sure to communicate as great ideas only come across when communicated effectively
7. Create an environment where re-use is encouraged
8. Work with sound assumptions and prove them
9. Never forget the big picture
10. Encourage your team to create change and always take accountability (especially when the outlook doesn't look great at times)
