There are many programmers out there, but you can identify the good ones by asking the following questions:
1.	Which programming language do you use/prefer?
2.	Which version control system do you use/prefer?
3.	Which collaboration platform do you use/prefer?
The exact answer that they give for each of the questions is less important than the fact that they have an answer.  You are looking to find out that they are familiar with a relevant programming language (q1), use version control systems and acknowledge that they will make mistakes at some point (q2) and use collaboration platforms such as GitHub).

Besides finding a good individual, you want to ensure the engineer is a good fit for your team. The Pragmatic Programmer talks about Pragmatic Teams and gives the following tips:
-	Quality is a team issue (do not tolerate “broken windows”)
-	Ensure everybody monitors the environment (avoid “boiled frogs)
-	Communicate!
-	Avoid duplication
-	Orthogonality (create a team structure around functionality, not job function)
-	Automation 
-	Give each team member the ability to shine
