There are three hiring alternatives that should be evaluated before starting a project: i) hiring a full-time employee, ii) hiring a Dev. Shop, iii) hiring a contractor. 

Benefits of hiring FT employee:
- Dedicated team focusing 100% on the project
- Lower turnover / higher commitment is beneficial in the long run
- Cheapest alternative
- Work done by the employee is proprietary
- Easier communication & more control of employeeâ€™s use of time
- Cost: $120 - 140K

Benefits of hiring Dev Shop:
- Higher execution speed: pool of engineers available
- Wider breadth of skill as a result of continuous training
- Higher flexibility: lower cost when there is not much work
- High capacity to replace engineers in case of turnover
- Cost: $250/h

Benefits of hiring Contractor:
- Cheaper than Dev Shop
- Serves as a way to hire FT engineers after testing them
- Unique engineer who is on top of the project
- Cost: $120 - 150K

Although hiring a FT employee would be the recommended choice in many cases, speed and flexibility might be critical factors for the project. This is why hiring a Dev Shop or Contractor is a suitable choice in project under pressure and very tight deadlines.
