This is a short summary of options for app development and a rationale how to choose. 

When thinking about developing an app there are 3 general possibilities: 
1) Using a standardized system (e.g. phonegap): high efficiency, low customizability
2) Using a developing framework for (e.g. titanium appcelerator): medium efficiency, medium customizability
3) Native developing: low efficiency, high customizability

The best choice thus depends on the situation and intent of your app.
If speed and low-cost is important, this favors standardized system over frameowrk over native. 
If speend and low-cost is not as important but you want to gain competitive advantage through superior functionalities or touch & feel, native is favored over framework over standardized system.
A developing framework if you would like to have the "best of both worlds".
