In deciding between creating a mobile app versus a website, consider the following:

1.	When building an app, you need to build codes for Android and iOS as well as for the web server.
2.	Cycle time is a lot longer on mobile apps.  For example, Appleâ€™s application approval process may take weeks.
3.	Complexity of updates: you may have to support many versions of the mobile app simultaneously.  Android apps must function on many different types of phones.
4.	You can store static content (images, etc.) in apps and thereby reduce the amount of downloaded content.
5.	Best practice is to assume that everyone will access site from mobile, so do not restrict functionality on your apps.
